                        <h2 class="section-heading">My personal experience as a gamer</h2>
                        <p>Back in the day, if you were a gamer, you either isolated or people will see you as a plague to the community. Especialy if you're from the Philippines where parents are very strict and want their child to work professionally in a traditional occupation. But in todays era, if you're a professional gamer, you can be compared to professional athletes when it comes to earnings, popularity or fanbase, and accomplishments. Video games are even part of the olympics now!</p>
                        <p>As far as I can remember, I started playing video games in game console shops when I was 5. But most of the time I'm only watching the kids that are playing since I don't have money to rent a console. The first game that I played in PC was starcraft, still when I was 5 since we have a computer printing shop back then. We stoped our computer business but little did we know that after few years computer shops will spread like fire when it comes to demand and popularity.</p>
                        <p>I played almost all genre of games from MOBA, RPG, Simulation and sports, Action-adventure, Real-time strategy and Shootering games. Recently, I'ved lay lowed on games because of work but I'm still a little active on NFT games even though the quality is bad but the earning is okay and I believe in the potential of NFT or blockchained games.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The integration of video games</h2>
                        <p>From the dawn of arcades, to the rise of home consoles, the gaming industry has risen exponentially in the past few decades.</p>
                        <p>In 2020, the global gaming industry's revenue is set to hit $165 billion, with 2.7 billion gamers worldwide today and was valued at USD 198.40 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach a value of USD 339.95 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 8.94% over 2022-2027.</p>
                        <p>In ten years, live streaming and virtual reality will define the way games are designed and played. Gamer-friendly and affordable headsets will be common by 2030. With streaming, VR will also get a boost, and gamers will no longer need a powerful gaming machine under their desk.</p>
